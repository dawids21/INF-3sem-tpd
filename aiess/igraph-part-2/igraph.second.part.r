# ================ 5. Plotting networks with igraph ================

#  ------->> Plot parameters in igraph --------

# Plotting with igraph: node options (starting with 'vertex.') and edge options
# (starting with 'edge.'). 
?igraph.plotting

# We can set the node & edge options in two ways - one is to specify
# them in the plot() function, as we are doing below.

plot(net, edge.arrow.size=.4, edge.curved=.1)

plot(net, 
     edge.arrow.size=.2, edge.curved=0,
     vertex.color="lavender", vertex.frame.color="darkgray",
     vertex.label=V(net)$media, vertex.label.color="black",
     vertex.label.cex=.7) 

# The second way to set attributes is to add them to the igraph object.

# Generate colors based on media type:
colrs <- c("gray", "tomato", "gold")
V(net)$color <- colrs[V(net)$media.type]

# Set node size based on audience size:
V(net)$size <- V(net)$audience.size*0.7

# Set node label color:
V(net)$label.color <- "black"

# Set edge width based on weight:
E(net)$width <- E(net)$weight/6

# Change arrow size and edge color:
E(net)$arrow.size <- .2
E(net)$color <- "gray"

# All visual attributes are stored in the graph
net
plot(net) 

# We can also override the attributes explicitly in the plot:
plot(net, edge.color="gray", vertex.color="orange") 

# Sometimes, especially with semantic networks, we may be interested in 
# plotting only the labels of the nodes:
plot(net, vertex.shape="none", vertex.label=V(net)$media, 
     vertex.label.font=2, vertex.label.color="black",
     vertex.label.cex=.7, edge.color="lightgray")


# Let's color the edges of the graph based on their source node color.
# We'll get the starting node for each edge with "ends()".
ends(net, es=E(net))
edge.start <- ends(net, es=E(net), names=F)[,1]
edge.col <- V(net)$color[edge.start]

plot(net, edge.color=edge.col, edge.curved=.1)

#  ------->> Network Layouts --------

# Network layouts are algorithms that return coordinates for each
# node in a network.

plot(net.bg)

# You can set the layout in the plot function:
plot(net.bg, layout=layout_randomly)
plot(net.bg, layout=layout_nicely)

# Or calculate the vertex coordinates in advance:
l <- layout_in_circle(net.bg)
l
plot(net.bg, layout=l)

# l is simply a matrix of x,y coordinates (N x 2) for the N nodes in the graph. 
# You can generate your own:
l <- cbind(1:vcount(net.bg), c(1:vcount(net.bg))**10)
plot(net.bg, layout=l)

# Randomly placed vertices
l <- layout_randomly(net.bg)

# Circle layout
l <- layout_in_circle(net.bg)

# 3D sphere layout
l <- layout_on_sphere(net.bg)

# The Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm 
# Nice but slow, most often used in graphs smaller than ~1000 vertices. 
l <- layout_with_fr(net.bg)
plot(net.bg, layout=l)

# You will also notice that the layout is not deterministic - different runs 
# will result in slightly different configurations. Saving the layout in l
# allows us to get the exact same result multiple times.
par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(1,1,1,1))

# By default, the coordinates of the plots are rescaled to the [-1,1] interval
# for both x and y. You can change that with the parameter "rescale=FALSE"
# and rescale your plot manually by multiplying the coordinates by a scalar.
# You can use norm_coords to normalize the plot with the boundaries you want.

# Get the layout coordinates:

# ------->> Improving network plots --------

plot(net)

# Notice that this network plot is still not too helpful.
# We can identify the type and size of nodes, but cannot see
# much about the structure since the links we're examining are so dense.
# One way to approach this is to see if we can sparsify the network.

sd(links$weight)

# There are more sophisticated ways to extract the key edges,
# but for the purposes of this excercise we'll only keep ones
# that have weight higher than the mean for the network.

# We can delete edges using delete_edges(net, edges)
cut.off <- mean(links$weight) 
net.sp <- delete_edges(net, E(net)[weight<cut.off])
plot(net.sp, layout=layout_components) 

# Another way to think about this is to plot the two tie types 
# (hyperlik & mention) separately:

E(net)$width <- 2
plot(net, 
     edge.color=c("darkred", "steelblue")[(E(net)$type=="hyperlink")+1],
     vertex.color="gray", 
     layout=layout_in_circle)

# Another way to delete edges:  
net.m <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type=="hyperlink"]
net.h <- net - E(net)[E(net)$type=="mention"]

# Plot the two links separately:
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

# ------->> EXERCISE <<------------------------------

# Use the stormofswords.csv file to read the network of "Game of Thrones"
# characters and their interactions. Plot the network as follows:
# - remove all edges that have the weight below the average weight
# - set the color of each node to light blue
# - set the color of node's edge to white
# - make the arrows very small
# - set edge color to light gray
# - set label color to black

# ------->> EXERCISE <<------------------------------

# Use the StormOfSwords network to compute a layout of your choosing.
# Manually modify the layout in such a way that the node "Aemon"
# is displayed in the upper-left corner of the plot

# ------->> EXERCISE <<------------------------------

# Plot the histogram representing the number of GoT characters'
# interactions (how many characters interact with one other character,
# how many characters interact with two other characters, etc.)


# ------->> EXERCISE <<------------------------------

# Plot the GoT network using betweenness as the metric used to 
# scale the size of each node. In addition, compute and plot the 
# distribution of degrees of the nodes.
